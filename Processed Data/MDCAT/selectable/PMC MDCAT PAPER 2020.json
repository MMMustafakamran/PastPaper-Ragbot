In our tutorial on half wave rectifiers, we have seen that a half wave rectifier makes use of only one-half cycle of the input alternating current. Thus a full wave rectifier is much more efficient (double+) than a half wave rectifier. This process of converting both half cycles of the input supply (alternating current) to direct current (DC) is termed full wave rectification Full wave rectifier can be constructed in 2 ways. The first method makes use of a centre tapped transformer and 2 diodes. This arrangement is known as center tapped full wave rectifier. The second method uses a normal transformer with 4 diodes arranged as a bridge. This arrangement is known as a bridge rectifier.",

In addition, highly excited atomsm can emit x-rays with discrete wavelengths characteristic of the energy level spacins in the atoms. The X-rays region of the electromagnetic spectrum falls far outside the rankge of visible wavelengths.",
