The public distribution system, which provides food at low prices, is subject if vital concern. There is a
growing realization that though Pakistan has enough food to feed its masses three square meals a
days, the monster of s starvation and food insecurity continues to haunt the poor in our country.
Increasing the purchasing power of the poor through providing productive employment leading to rising
income, and thus good standard of living is the ultimate objective of public policy. However, till then, there
is a need to provide assured supply of food through a restructured more efficient and decentralized public
distribution system (PDS).
Although the PDS is extensive- it is one of the largest such systems in the world - it has yet to reach the
rural poor and the far off places.it remains an urban phenomenon, with the majority of the rural poor
www.educatedzone.com

still out of its reach due to lack of economic and physical access. The poorest in the cities and the migrants
are left out, for they generally do not possess ration cards. The allocation of PDS supplies in big cities is
larger than in rural areas. In view of such deficiencies in the system, the PDS urgently needs to be steam
lined. In addition, considering the large food grains production combined with food subsidy on one hand
and the continuing slow starvation and dismal poverty of the rural population on the other, there is strong
case for making PDS target group oriented
The growing salaried class is provided job security, regular income, and %age insulation against inflation.
These gains of development have not percolated down to the vast majority of our working population.
If one compares only dearness allowance to the employees in public and private sector and looks at its
growth in past few years. The rising food subsidy is insignificant to the point of in equality. The food
subsidy is a kind of D.A to the poor, the self-employed and those in the organized sector of economy.
However, what is most unfortunate is that out of the large budget of the so-called food subsidy, the major
part of it is administrative cost and wastages. A small portion of the above budget goes to real consumer
and even lesser portion to the poor who are in real need.
It is true that subsidies should not become a permanent feature, except for the destitute, disabled widows
and the old. It is also true that subsidies often create a psychology of dependence and hence is habit-
forming, killing the general initiative of the people. By making PDS target group oriented, not only the
poorest and neediest would be reached without additional cost, but it will actually cut overall costs
incurred on large cities and for better off localities. When the food and food subsidy are limited the rural
and urban poor should have the priority in the PDS supplies. The PDS should be closely linked with PDS
should be closely linked with programs of employment generation and nutrition improvement.
