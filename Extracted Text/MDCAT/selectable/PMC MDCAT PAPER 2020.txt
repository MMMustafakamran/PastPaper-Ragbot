In our tutorial on half wave rectifiers, we have seen that a half wave rectifier
makes use of only one-half cycle of the input alternating current. Thus a full wave
rectifier is much more efficient (double+) than a half wave rectifier. This process
of converting both half cycles of the input supply (alternating current) to direct
current (DC) is termed full wave rectification
Full wave rectifier can be constructed in 2 ways.
The first method makes use of a centre tapped transformer and 2 diodes. This
arrangement is known as center tapped full wave rectifier.
The second method uses a normal transformer with 4 diodes arranged as a
bridge. This arrangement is known as a bridge rectifier.
