Educational planning should aim at meeting the educational needs of the entire population of
all age groups. While the traditional structure of education as a three layer hierarchy from the
primary stage to the Universities represents the court, we should not overlook the periphery
which is equally important. Under modern conditions, workers need to rewind, or renew their
enthusiasm, or strike out in a new direction or improve their as much as any university
professors. The retired and the aged have their needs as well. Educational planning, in their
words, should take care of the needs of every one.
Our structure of education have been built up on the assumption that there is a terminal
point to education. This basic defect has become all the more harmful today. A UNESCO report
entitled “Learning to be” prepared by edger Faure and others in 1973 asserts that the education
of children must prepare the future adult for various forms of self-learning a viably education
system of the future should consist of modules with different kinds of functions serving a diversity
of constituents. And performance, not the period of study, should be the basis for credentials. The
writing is already on the wall.
In view of the fact that the significance of a commitment of lifelong learning and lifetime
education is being discussed only a recent year even in educationally advanced countries, the
possibility of the idea becoming an integral part of educational thinking in to be a far cry. For,
to move in the direction means such more than some simple rearrangement of the present
organization of education but a good beginning can be made by developing open university
programs for older learners of different categories and introducing extension service in the
conventional colleges and schools also these Institutions should learn to cooperate with the
numerous community organizations such as libraries, museums, municipal recreational
programs, health service etc..
