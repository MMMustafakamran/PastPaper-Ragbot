Read the passage carefully and answer the following question given at the end of passage.
Democratic societies from the earliest times have expected their governments to protect the weak
against the strong. No ‘era of good feeling’ can justify discharging the police force or giving up the idea
of public control over concentrated private wealth. On the other hand, it is obvious that a spirit of self-
denial and moderation on the part of those who hold economic power will greatly soften the demand
for absolute equality. Men are more interested in freedom and security than in an equal distribution of
wealth. The extent to which government must interfere with business, therefore, is not exactly
measured by the extent to which economic power is concentrated into a few hands. The required
degree of government interference depends mainly on whether economic powers are oppressively
used, and on the necessity of keeping economic factors in a tolerable state of balance. But with the
necessity of meeting all these dangers and threats to liberty, the powers of government are unavoidably
increased, whichever political party may be in office. The growth of government is a necessary result of
the growth of technology and of the problems that go with the use of machines and science. Since the
government in our nation, must take on more powers to meet its problems, there is no way to preserve
freedom except by making democracy more powerful.
